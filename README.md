This is a first version of the design, and I looked for a lot of use cases of the AK4118 on the network, very few. Therefore, I came up with the idea of making a simple control code configuration AK4118 + AK4497 + 0.96 OLED DAC file, which can print the detected frequency to OLED, due to time reasons I did not go deep into the development, I believe that in the future I will add rotary encoder and button + HMI to control, at present, these codes can reduce the use of AK chips when reading a large number of register configuration related work. Of course it's not perfect, if you have a good suggestion please let me know. xinq88@qq.com
Recently I updated the circuit schematic and PCB
